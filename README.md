#### by Kun Ren


[rlist](http://renkun.me/rlist) is a set of tools for working with list objects. Its goal is to make it easier to work with lists by providing a wide range of functions on non-tabular data stored in them.

This package supports list filtering, mapping, grouping, sorting, updating, searching, file input/output, and many other functions. It implements collection pipeline and strongly recommends functional programming style in list operations.
