# Comparers

`list.filter()` and `list.search()` are two major functions to find values that meet certain conditions. The condition is most likely to be a comparison, which can be done by exact comparing, atomic comparing, pattern matching by regular expression, string distance comparing, and so on.

In this page, we will introduce the usage of these comparers with filtering and searching functions and you will know more about how to perform logical and fuzzy data selection.
