# Features

In this chapter, the features of rlist will be demonstrated in detail. Although each function in the package is designed to do only a simple thing, it is the combination of functions that make it much easier to work with non-tabular data represented by lists.

The main features of rlist are listed below:

- Mapping
- Selecting
- Filtering
- Sorting
- Grouping
- Joining
- Updating
- Searching
- Fuzzy comparer
- Input/Output
- Lambda expression
- List environment

Each category may include one or more functions. In addition to the featured functions, a number of helper functions are covered along with them too. 

As more features are introduced, the later pages will use more functions and combinations than former pages in the beginning.
