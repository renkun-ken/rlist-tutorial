# Getting started

Before getting started, please ensure you have installed the latest version of rlist.

This tutorial will introduce most features of the package in detail. Some of the features are only available in the latest development version.

You can install the latest stable release (v0.3-2) from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlist):

```r
install.packages("rlist")
```

or the latest development version (v0.3-3) from [GitHub](https://github.com/renkun-ken/rlist) with `devtools`:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("renkun-ken/rlist")
```

We recommend that you install the dev version to keep up with the new features which are also covered in the code examples in this tutorial.
