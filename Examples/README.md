# Examples

The power of rlist functionality does not lie in a single function but in the combination of functions in a chain, which makes non-tabular data manipulation much easier. 

This chapter contains a few examples to demonstrate comprehensive uses of rlist functionality. The examples use real-world non-tabular data sources from [GitHub API](http://api.github.com) and [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org).
